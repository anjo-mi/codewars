Instead, they will transform your password into something else using a cryptographic hashing algorithm.</p><p>After the password is transformed, it is then called a <em>password hash</em>.  Whenever you try to login, the website will transform the password you tried using the same hashing algorithm and simply see if the password hashes are the same.</p><hr><p>Create the function that converts a given string into an <code>md5</code> hash.  The return value should be encoded in <code>hexadecimal</code>.</p><p>Remember that you can include the builtin <code>require()</code> function to include external modules (you're not expected to implement MD5 hash algorithm yourself, there are many modules that can do that for you).</p><p>If you're not familiar with modules, see <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/541db50c259d9c55c00007b9" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">this kata</a>.</p><p>NodeJS documentation <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><h2 id="code-examples">Code Examples</h2><pre><code>passHash("password") // --&gt; "5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99"passHash("abc123") // --&gt; "e99a18c428cb38d5f260853678922e03"</code></pre><p>If you want to externally test a string, <a href="http://www.md5hasher.net/" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">look at this website</a>.</p><hr><p>As a side note, <code>md5</code> can be exploited, so never use it for anything secure.  The reason I used it in this kata is simply because it is a very common hashing algorithm and many people will recognize the name.</p>
