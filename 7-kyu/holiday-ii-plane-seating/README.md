You arrive, realise again just how little leg room you get, and sort of climb into the seat covered in a pile of your own stuff.</p><p>To help confuse matters (although they claim in an effort to do the opposite) many airlines omit the letters 'I' and 'J' from their seat naming system.</p><p>the naming system consists of a number (in this case between 1-60) that denotes the section of the plane where the seat is (1-20 = front, 21-40 = middle, 41-60 = back). This number is followed by a letter, A-K with the exclusions mentioned above.</p><p>Letters A-C denote seats on the left cluster, D-F the middle and G-K the right.</p><p>Given a seat number, your task is to return the seat location in the following format:</p><p>'2B' would return 'Front-Left'.</p><p>If the number is over 60, or the letter is not valid, return 'No Seat!!'.</p>
