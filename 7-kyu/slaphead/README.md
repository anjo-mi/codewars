Nothing worse that a stray hair waving in the wind. </p><p>You will be given a string(x). Clean shaved head is shown as "-" and stray hairs are shown as "/". Your task is to check the head for stray hairs and get rid of them. </p><p>You should return the original string, but with any stray hairs removed. Keep count ot them though, as there is a second element you need to return:</p><p>0 hairs --&gt; "Clean!"<br>1 hair --&gt; "Unicorn!"<br>2 hairs --&gt; "Homer!"<br>3-5 hairs --&gt; "Careless!"<br>&gt;5 hairs --&gt; "Hobo!"</p><p>So for this head: "------/------" you shoud return:<br></p><p>["-------------", "Unicorn"]</p>
