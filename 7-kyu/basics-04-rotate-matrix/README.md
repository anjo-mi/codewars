The matrix is an array of integers with dimension n,m. So this kata checks some basics, it's not too difficult.<br><br>There's nothing more to explain, no tricks, no "bad cases";-). Perhaps you take a look at the testcases...</p><p><b>One easy example:</b><br></p><pre><code>Input: {{-1, 4, 5},        { 2, 3, 4}}Output: {{ 5, 4},         { 4, 3},         {-1, 2}}</code></pre><p>First there are some static tests, later on random tests too...<br><br></p><h2><span style="color:red">Hope you have fun:-)!</span></h2>
