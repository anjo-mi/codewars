It turns out that <code>198</code> is the only number with this property. However, the property can be generalized so that each digit is concatenated <code>n</code> times and then summed. </p><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><pre><code>original number =2997 , n=32997 = 222+999+999+777 and here each digit is concatenated three times.original number=-2997 , n=3-2997 = -222-999-999-777 and here each digit is concatenated three times.</code></pre><h2 id="task">Task</h2><p>Write a function named <code>checkConcatenatedSum</code> that tests if a number has this generalized property.</p>
