The book is full of a bunch of problems, and each problem consists of two strings that are similar. However, in each string there are a few characters that are different. An example puzzle from her book is:</p><pre><code>String 1: "abcdefg"String 2: "abcqetg"</code></pre><p>Notice how the "d" from String 1 has become a "q" in String 2, and "f" from String 1 has become a "t" in String 2.</p><p>It's your job to help Mary solve the puzzles. Write a program <code>spot_diff</code>/<code>Spot</code> that will compare the two strings and return a list with the positions where the two strings differ. In the example above, your program should return <code>[3, 5]</code> because String 1 is different from String 2 at positions 3 and 5.</p><p>NOTES:</p><p>• If both strings are the same, return <code>[]</code></p><p>• Both strings will always be the same length</p><p>• Capitalization and punctuation matter</p>
