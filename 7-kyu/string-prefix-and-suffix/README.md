<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/5ce969ab07d4b7002dcaa7a1/train/javascript target="_blank">String prefix and suffix</a></h2><h3>7 kyu</h3><p>In this Kata, you will be given a string and your task will be to return the length of the longest prefix that is also a suffix. A prefix is the start of a string while the suffix is the end of a string.  For instance, the prefixes of the string <code>"abcd"</code> are <code>["a","ab","abc"]</code>. The suffixes are <code>["bcd", "cd", "d"]</code>. You should not overlap the prefix and suffix.</p><pre><code class="language-Haskell">for example:solve("abcd") = 0, because no prefix == suffix. solve("abcda") = 1, because the longest prefix which == suffix is "a".solve("abcdabc") = 3. Longest prefix which == suffix is "abc".solve("aaaa") = 2. Longest prefix which == suffix is "aa". You should not overlap the prefix and suffixsolve("aa") = 1. You should not overlap the prefix and suffix.solve("a") = 0. You should not overlap the prefix and suffix.</code></pre><p>All strings will be lowercase and string lengths are <code>1 &lt;= length &lt;= 500</code></p><p>More examples in test cases. Good luck!</p>
