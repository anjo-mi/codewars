Notice that there are negatives in the list.</p><p>List is always not empty and contains only integers. Return <code>None</code> if it is not possible to define only one of such values. And of course, we are expecting 0 as closest value to zero.</p><p>Examples:</p><pre><code class="language-code">[2, 4, -1, -3]  =&gt; -1[5, 2, -2]      =&gt; None[5, 2, 2]       =&gt; 2[13, 0, -6]     =&gt; 0</code></pre>
