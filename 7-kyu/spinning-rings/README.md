The inner ring spins clockwise (decreasing by 1 each spin) and the outer ring spins counter clockwise (increasing by 1 each spin). We start with both rings aligned on 0 at the top, and on each move we spin each ring one increment. How many moves will it take before both rings show the same number at the top again?</p><p>The inner ring has integers from 0 to innerMax and the outer ring has integers from 0 to outerMax, where innerMax and outerMax are integers &gt;= 1.</p><pre><code>e.g. if innerMax is 2 and outerMax is 3 then after1 move: inner = 2, outer = 12 moves: inner = 1, outer = 23 moves: inner = 0, outer = 34 moves: inner = 2, outer = 05 moves: inner = 1, outer = 1Therefore it takes 5 moves for the two rings to reach the same numberTherefore spinningRings(2, 3) = 5</code></pre><pre><code>e.g. if innerMax is 3 and outerMax is 2 then after1 move: inner = 3, outer = 12 moves: inner = 2, outer = 2Therefore it takes 2 moves for the two rings to reach the same numberspinningRings(3, 2) = 2</code></pre><hr><p>for a bigger challenge, check out the <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/59b0b7cd2a00d219ab0000c5" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">Performance Version</a> of this kata by @Voile</p>
