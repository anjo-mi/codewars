<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/57e92812750fcc051800004d/train/javascript target="_blank">Holiday VII - Local Talk</a></h2><h3>7 kyu</h3><p>In Bali, as far as I can gather, when ex-pats speak to locals, they basically insert the word 'Pak' as often as possible. I am assured it means something like 'mate' or 'sir' but that could be completely wrong. </p><p>Anyway, as some basic language education(??) this kata requires you to turn any sentence provided (s) into ex-pat balinese waffle by inserting the word 'pak' between every other word. Simple 8kyu :D</p><p>Pak should not be the first or last word. Strings of just spaces should return an empty string.</p>
