So the first letter isgiven the code 0, and second is then assigned 1 if it is different to the first letteror 0 otherwise, and so on.</p><p>As an example, the word "hello" would become "0.1.2.2.3". For this task case-sensitivityis ignored, so "hello", "helLo" and "heLlo" will all return the same word pattern.</p><p>Your task is to return the word pattern for a given word. All words provided willbe non-empty strings of alphabetic characters only, i.e. matching the regex "[a-zA-Z]+".</p>
