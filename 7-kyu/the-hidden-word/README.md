The article is not complete without this word. Maya has a friend, Dan, and he is very good with words, but he doesn't like to just give them away. He texts Maya a number and she needs to find out the hidden word. The words can contain only the letter:</p><pre><code>"a", "b", "d", "e", "i", "l", "m", "n", "o", and "t".</code></pre><p>Luckily, Maya has the key:</p><pre><code>"a" : 6"b" : 1 "d" : 7"e" : 4"i" : 3"l" : 2"m" : 9"n" : 8"o" : 0"t" : 5</code></pre><p>You can help Maya by writing a function that will take a number between 100 and 999999 and return a string with the word. </p><p>The input is always a number, contains only the numbers in the key. The output should be always a string with one word, all lowercase.</p><p>Maya won't forget to thank you at the end of her article :) </p>
