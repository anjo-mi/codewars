The function should return the mean between the mean of the the first x elements of the array and the mean of the last y elements of the array.</p><p>The mean should be computed if both x and y have values higher than 1 but less or equal to the array's length. Otherwise the function should return -1.</p><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><pre><code>[1, 3, 2, 4], 2, 3 =&gt; should return 2.5</code></pre><p>because: the mean of the the first 2 elements of the array is (1+3)/2=2 and the mean of the last 3 elements of the array is (4+2+3)/3=3 so the mean of those 2 means is (2+3)/2=2.5.</p><pre><code>[1, 3, 2, 4], 1, 2 =&gt; should return -1</code></pre><p>because x is not higher than 1.</p><pre><code>[1, 3, 2, 4], 2, 8 =&gt; should return -1</code></pre><p>because 8 is higher than the array's length.</p>
