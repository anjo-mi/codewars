You should not rely on the number of dimensions to solve this kata. If <i>n</i> is the number of dimensions, then: 1 &lt;= n &lt; +Infinity.</p><p>Example:</p><p>Given [[[5], 3], 0, 2, [], [4, [5, 6]]], your function should return a result of 7. This is because the array contains 7 integers.</p><p>Addendum:</p><p>Think of it as dimension-agnostic value counting. We want to know the total number of integers inside the array and we don't care for the dimensions.</p>
