He came up with a solution:</p><ol><li><p>Add digits in random places within the message.</p></li><li><p>Split the resulting message in two. He wrote down every second character on one page, and the remaining ones on another. He then dispatched the two messages separately.</p></li></ol><p>Write a function interweave(s1, s2) that reverses this operation to decode his message!</p><p>Example 1: interweave("hlo", "el") -&gt; "hello"Example 2: interweave("h3lo", "el4") -&gt; "hello"</p><p>Rick's a bit peculiar about his formats. He would feel ashamed if he found out his message led to extra white spaces hanging around the edges of his message...</p>
