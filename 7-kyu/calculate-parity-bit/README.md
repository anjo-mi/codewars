Parity bits are used as the simplest form of error detecting code.</p><p>You have two parameters, one being the wanted parity (always 'even' or 'odd'), and the other being the binary representation of the number you want to check.</p><p>Your task is to return an integer (<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>), whose parity bit you need to add to the binary representation so that the parity of the resulting string is as expected.</p><p>Example:</p><pre><code>  Parity: 'even'  Bin: '0101010'  Result: 1</code></pre><p>Because there is an odd number of 1-bits (3) you need to put another <code>1</code> to it to get an even number of 1-bits.</p><p>For more information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_bit</a></p>
