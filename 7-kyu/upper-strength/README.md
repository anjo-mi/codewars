<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/571640812ad763313600132b/train/javascript target="_blank">Upper <body> Strength</a></h2><h3>7 kyu</h3><p>Alex is transitioning from website design to coding and wants to sharpen his skills with CodeWars.<br>He can do ten kata in an hour, but when he makes a mistake, he must do pushups. These pushups really tire poor Alex out, so every time he does them they take twice as long. His first set of redemption pushups takes 5 minutes. Create a function, <code>alexMistakes</code>, that takes two arguments: the number of kata he needs to complete, and the time in minutes he has to complete them. Your function should return how many mistakes Alex can afford to make.</p>
