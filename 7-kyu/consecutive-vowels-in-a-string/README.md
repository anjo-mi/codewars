Your job is to find out how many ordered and consecutive vowels there are in the given string beginning from <code>'a'</code>. Keep in mind that the consecutive vowel to <code>'u'</code> is <code>'a'</code> and the cycle continues.</p><p>Return an integer with the length of the consecutive vowels found.</p><p>This is better explained with a couple of examples:</p><ol><li>You are given the string <code>"agrtertyfikfmroyrntbvsukldkfa"</code>. The logic is that you start from the <code>'a'</code> and make your way right. The next vowel is an <code>'e'</code> and it is the consecutive vowel, then <code>'i'</code> and so forth until you get to <code>'u'</code>. If you keep moving right you find <code>'a'</code> which happens to be the consecutive vowel. Return <code>6</code>.</li><li>This is a slightly trickier example: you are given the string <code>"erfaiekjudhyfimngukduo"</code>. As you move right you ignore all vowels until you get to the <code>'a'</code>, then ignore the rest until you get to the <code>'e'</code>, which is the consecutive vowel, and so forth until you get to the <code>'o'</code>. Return <code>4</code>.</li></ol><h1 id="note">Note</h1><p>For this kata, the vowels are <code>'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'</code>, in that order. <code>'y'</code> is not considered a vowel in this kata.</p><p>Good luck!</p>
