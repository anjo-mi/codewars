Because you are also a programmer, you have decided to write a function.</p><p>This function, arithmetic_sequence_sum(a, r, n), should return the sum of the first (n) elements of a sequence in which each element is the sum of the given integer (a), and a number of occurences of the given integer (r), based on the element's position within the sequence.</p><p>For example:</p><p>arithmetic_sequence_sum(2, 3, 5) should return 40:</p><pre><code>1     2        3          4            5a + (a+r) + (a+r+r) + (a+r+r+r) + (a+r+r+r+r) 2 + (2+3) + (2+3+3) + (2+3+3+3) + (2+3+3+3+3) = 40</code></pre>
