Each element within the Outer-Array represents a shockwave, and each element within the Inner-Arrays represents a tremor. The magnitude of the earthquake is determined by the product of the values of its shockwaves. A shockwave is equal to the sum of the values of its tremors. </p><p>Example earthquake --&gt; <code>[[5,3,7],[3,3,1],[4,1,2]] ((5+3+7) * (3+3+1) * (4+1+2)) = 735</code></p><p>A building begins with a strength value of 1000 when first built, but this value is subject to exponential decay of 1% per year.
