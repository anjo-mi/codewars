<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/56e56756404bb1c950000992/train/javascript target="_blank">Sum of differences between products and LCMs</a></h2><h3>7 kyu</h3><p>In this kata you need to create a function that takes a 2D array/list of non-negative integer pairs and returns the sum of all the "saving" that you can have getting the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">LCM</a> of each couple of number compared to their simple product.</p><p>For example, if you are given:</p><pre><code>[[15,18], [4,5], [12,60]]</code></pre><p>Their product would be:</p><pre><code>[270, 20, 720]</code></pre><p>While their respective LCM would be:</p><pre><code>[90, 20, 60]</code></pre><p>Thus the result should be:</p><pre><code>(270-90)+(20-20)+(720-60)==840</code></pre><p>This is a kata that I made, among other things, to let some of my trainees familiarize with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm" data-turbolinks="false" target="_blank">euclidean algorithm</a>, a really neat tool to have on your belt ;)</p>
