For example if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will choose theurinal on the right and not the one in the middle.That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first person pees into urinal 2 or 4).</p><p><img alt="Imgur Urinals" src="https://i.imgur.com/imZE6xm.png"></p><h2 id="your-task">Your task:</h2><p>You need to write a function that returns the maximum of free urinals as an integer according to the unwritten rule.</p><h3 id="input">Input</h3><p>A String containing 1s and 0s (Example: <code>10001</code>) (1 &lt;= Length &lt;= 20)<br>A one stands for a taken urinal and a zero for a free one. </p><h3 id="examples">Examples</h3><p><code>10001</code> returns 1 (10101)<br><code>1001</code> returns 0 (1001)<br><code>00000</code> returns 3 (10101)<br><code>0000</code> returns 2 (1001)<br><code>01000</code> returns 1 (01010 or 01001) </p><h3 id="note">Note</h3><p>When there is already a mistake in the input string (for example <code>011</code>), then return <code>-1</code></p><p>Have fun and don't pee into the wrong urinal ;)</p>
