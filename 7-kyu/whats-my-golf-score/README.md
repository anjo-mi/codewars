I have them stored as strings, because I wrote them down on a sheet of paper.  Right now, I'm using those strings to calculate my golf score by hand: take the difference between my actual <code>score</code> and the <code>par</code> of the hole, and add up the results for all 18 holes.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>If I took 7 shots on a hole where the par was 5, my score would be: 7 - 5 = 2</li><li>If I got a hole-in-one where the par was 4, my score would be: 1 - 4 = -3.</li></ul><p>Doing all this math by hand is really hard! Can you help make my life easier?</p><h2 id="task-overview">Task Overview</h2><p>Complete the function which accepts two strings and calculates the golf score of a game. Both strings will be of length 18, and each character in the string will be a number between 1 and 9 inclusive. </p>
