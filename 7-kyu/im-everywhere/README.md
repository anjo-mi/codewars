Let's help him do it, too.</p><h3 id="task">Task:</h3><p>Your task is to make a function that takes the value of <strong>word</strong> and returns it with an "i" at the beginning of the word. For example we get the word "Phone", so we must return "iPhone". But we have a few rules:</p><ol><li>The word should not begin with the letter "I", for example <strong>Inspire</strong>.</li><li>The number of vowels should not be greater than or equal to the number of consonants, for example <strong>East</strong> or <strong>Peace</strong>. ("y" is considered a consonant)</li><li>The first letter should not be lowercase, for example <strong>road</strong>.</li></ol><p>If the word does not meet the rules, we return "Invalid word".</p>
