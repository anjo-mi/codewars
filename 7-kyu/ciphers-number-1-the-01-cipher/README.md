This series is meant to test our coding knowledge.</em></p><h2 id="ciphers-1---the-01-cipher">Ciphers #1 - The 01 Cipher</h2><p>This cipher doesn't exist, I just created it by myself. It can't actually be used, as there isn't a way to decode it. It's a hash. Multiple sentences may also have the same result.</p><h2 id="how-this-cipher-works">How this cipher works</h2><p>It looks at the letter, and sees it's index in the alphabet, the alphabet being <code>a-z</code>, if you didn't know. If it is odd, it is replaced with <code>1</code>, if it's even, its replaced with <code>0</code>. Note that the index should start from 0. Also, if the character isn't a letter, it remains the same.</p><h2 id="example">Example</h2><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-variable">encode</span>(<span class="cm-string">"Hello World!"</span>); <span class="cm-comment">// =&gt; "10110 00111!"</span></code></pre><p>This is because <code>H</code>'s index is <code>7</code>, which is odd, so it is replaced by <code>1</code>, and so on.</p><p>Have fun (en)coding!</p>
