<h2><a href=https://www.codewars.com/kata/52d43d5515be7cbc92000611/train/javascript target="_blank">Tree leaves at same level</a></h2><h3>5 kyu</h3><p>A binary tree is a structure that has a value and two references to its child: left and right. Each of these references are themselves a binary tree or undefined to represent an empty tree.</p><p>The leaves in a binary tree are the lower level nodes for which both references (left and right) are undefined. For example, in the following tree:</p><pre><code>  a / \b  c    \    d</code></pre><p>'b' and 'd' are leaves while 'a' and 'c' are not.We define the level of a tree as the number of parent nodes a tree node has. The root of the tree, therefore, is at level 0. Root's children are at level 1, etc.</p><p>The goal of this kata is to write a function to determine if all leaves of a binary tree are at the same level.In the tree shown before the function should return false since 'b' and 'd' are at levels 1 and 2, respectively.</p><p>In the following example, the function should return true because now the leaves are 'e' and 'd' and both are at level 2:</p><pre><code>   a  / \ b   c /    \e      d</code></pre><p>In this next example:</p><pre><code>    a   /   b   /  e </code></pre><p>the function should also return true because 'e' is the only leaf.</p><p>If the function is passed an empty tree (undefined) it should return true. Similarly, if the tree has only 1 node (the root node) the function should return true.</p><p>The Node class can be used as follows:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-def">n</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-variable">Node</span>(<span class="cm-number">1</span>,<span class="cm-atom">undefined</span>,<span class="cm-variable">Node</span>(<span class="cm-number">2</span>,<span class="cm-atom">undefined</span>,<span class="cm-atom">undefined</span>));<span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-def">nLeft</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-variable">n</span>.<span class="cm-property">getLeft</span>();<span class="cm-keyword">var</span> <span class="cm-def">nRight</span> <span class="cm-operator">=</span> <span class="cm-variable">n</span>.<span class="cm-property">getRight</span>();</code></pre>
