All of them are supposed to be the same as the original but, unfortunately, they were corrupted which means some of the characters were replaced with asterisks (<code>"*"</code>).</p><p>You have to restore the original string based on non-corrupted information you have. If in some cases it is not possible to determine what the original character was, use <code>"#"</code> character as a special marker for that.</p><p>If the array is empty, then return an empty string.</p><h3 id="examples">Examples:</h3><pre><code>input = [  "a*cde",  "*bcde",  "abc*e"]result = "abcde"input = [  "a*c**",  "**cd*",  "a*cd*"]result = "a#cd#"</code></pre>
