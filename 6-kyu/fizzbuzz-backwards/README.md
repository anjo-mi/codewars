But we could also play FizzBuzz with any other integer pair <code>[n, m]</code> whose multiples are replaced with Fizz and Buzz. </p><p>For a sequence of numbers, Fizzes, Buzzes and FizzBuzzes, find the numbers whose multiples are being replaced by Fizz and Buzz. Return them as an array <code>[n, m]</code></p><p>The Fizz and Buzz numbers will always be integers between 1 and 50, and the sequence will have a maximum length of 100. The Fizz and Buzz numbers might be equal, and might be equal to 1.</p><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><ul><li>Classic FizzBuzz; multiples of 3 are replaced by Fizz, multiples of 5 are replaced by Buzz:<pre><code>[1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", 6]  ==&gt;  [3, 5] </code></pre></li><li>Multiples of 2 are replaced by Fizz, multiples of 3 are replaced by Buzz:<pre><code>[1, "Fizz", "Buzz", "Fizz", 5, "FizzBuzz"]  ==&gt;  [2, 3]</code></pre></li><li>Multiples of 2 are replaced by Fizz and Buzz:<pre><code>[1, "FizzBuzz", 3, "FizzBuzz", 5, "FizzBuzz"]  ==&gt;  [2, 2]</code></pre></li><li>Fizz = 1, Buzz = 6:<pre><code>["Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "Fizz", "FizzBuzz"]  ==&gt;  [1, 6]</code></pre></li></ul>
