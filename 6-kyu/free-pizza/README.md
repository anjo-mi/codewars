Your manager wants you to implement a function that, given a dictionary of customers, a minimum number of orders and a minimum order value, returns a <strong>set</strong> of the customers who are eligible for a reward.</p><p>Customers in the dictionary are represented as:</p><pre><code class="language-python">{ <span class="cm-string">'customerName'</span> : [<span class="cm-variable">list_of_order_values_as_integers</span>] }</code></pre><p>See example test case for more details.</p>
