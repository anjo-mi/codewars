By this I mean the internal letters will move out, and the external letters move toward the centre. </p><p>If the word is even length, all letters will move. If the length is odd, you are expected to leave the 'middle' letter of the word where it is. </p><p>An example should clarify:</p><p>'taxi' would become 'atix''taxis' would become 'atxsi'</p>
