Any characters which are not vowels should remain in their original position. Here are some examples:</p><pre><code>"Hello!" =&gt; "Holle!""Tomatoes" =&gt; "Temotaos""Reverse Vowels In A String" =&gt; "RivArsI Vewols en e Streng"</code></pre><p>For simplicity, you can treat the letter y as a consonant, not a vowel.</p><p>Good luck!</p>
