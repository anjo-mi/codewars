This should come in handy in many places where dice are involved, like this kata.</p><p>But first, we need to talk about parallel universes, and how much better the odds become when you can roll simultaneously in many of them.</p><p>Given the number of faces of the dice you're rolling <code>1&lt;=dice&lt;=1000</code> (the faces have values from 1 to <code>dice</code>) and number of rolls <code>2&lt;=n&lt;=100</code>, calculate the difference between the mean of <em>the maximum value of all the dice you rolled</em> to the mean of the same but for <em>just 1 roll</em>.</p><p>Due to the intrinsic quantum fluctuation among the parallel universes (or so you're told), the error for the calculation results will be noticable. However, you're okay if the results does not differ more than <code>1/10000</code> from the actual value.</p><p>An example:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-variable">meanMax</span>(<span class="cm-number">3</span>,<span class="cm-number">2</span>) <span class="cm-comment">// Dice value: (1,2,3), rolls: 2</span><span class="cm-comment">// Possibilities are:</span><span class="cm-comment">// 1: (1,1)</span><span class="cm-comment">// 2: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)</span><span class="cm-comment">// 3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)</span><span class="cm-comment">// Mean: (1*1 + 2*3 + 3*5) / 9 = 2.4444...</span><span class="cm-comment">// Rolling the dice once gives a mean of 2, so the answer is</span><span class="cm-comment">// 2.4444... - 2 = 0.4444...</span></code></pre><pre style="display: none;"><code class="language-python"><span class="cm-variable">mean_max</span>(<span class="cm-number">3</span>,<span class="cm-number">2</span>) <span class="cm-comment"># Dice value: (1,2,3), rolls: 2</span><span class="cm-comment"># Possibilities are:</span><span class="cm-comment"># 1: (1,1)</span><span class="cm-comment"># 2: (1,2), (2,1), (2,2)</span><span class="cm-comment"># 3: (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)</span><span class="cm-comment"># Mean: (1*1 + 2*3 + 3*5) / 9 = 2.4444...</span><span class="cm-comment"># Rolling the dice once gives a mean of 2, so the answer is</span><span class="cm-comment"># 2.4444... - 2 = 0.4444...</span></code></pre><p>Additional challenge: Come up with at least 3 ways to solve this kata.</p>
