Every time he finds a new number he throws it on the top of his number-pile. Help Sam organise his collection so he can take it to the International Number Collectors Conference in Cologne. </p><p>Given an array of numbers, your function should return an array of arrays, where each subarray contains all the duplicates of a particular number. Subarrays should be in the same order as the first occurence of the number they contain:</p><pre><code class="language-javascript"><span class="cm-variable">group</span>([<span class="cm-number">3</span>, <span class="cm-number">2</span>, <span class="cm-number">6</span>, <span class="cm-number">2</span>, <span class="cm-number">1</span>, <span class="cm-number">3</span>])<span class="cm-operator">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> [[<span class="cm-number">3</span>, <span class="cm-number">3</span>], [<span class="cm-number">2</span>, <span class="cm-number">2</span>], [<span class="cm-number">6</span>], [<span class="cm-number">1</span>]]</code></pre><p>Assume the input is always going to be an array of numbers. If the input is an empty array, an empty array should be returned.</p>
