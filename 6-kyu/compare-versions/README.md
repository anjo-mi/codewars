This causes his method to fail, as 10.9 is greater than 10.10 when interpreting both as numbers, despite being a lesser version.</p><p>Help Karan by writing him a function which compares two versions, and returns whether or not the first one is greater than or equal to the second.</p><p>Specification notes:</p><ul><li>Versions are provided as strings of one or more integers separated by <code>.</code>.</li><li>The version strings will never be empty.</li><li>The two versions are not guaranteed to have an equal amount of sub-versions, when this happens assume that all missing sub-versions are zero.</li><li>Two versions which differ only by trailing zero sub-versions will never be given.</li></ul>
