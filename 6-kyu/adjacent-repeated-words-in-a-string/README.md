For example, you've been distracted for a second. Did you notice that <em>"the"</em> is doubled in the first sentence of this description?</p><p>As as aS you can see, it's not easy to spot those errors, especially if words differ in case, like <em>"as"</em> at the beginning of this sentence.</p><p>Write a function that counts the number of sections repeating the same word (case insensitive). The occurence of two or more equal words next after each other counts as one.</p><h2 id="examples">Examples</h2><pre><code>"dog cat"                  --&gt;  0"dog DOG cat"              --&gt;  1"apple dog cat"            --&gt;  0"pineapple apple dog cat"  --&gt;  0"apple apple dog cat"      --&gt;  1"apple dog apple dog cat"  --&gt;  0"dog dog DOG dog dog dog"  --&gt;  1"dog dog dog dog cat cat"  --&gt;  2"cat cat dog dog cat cat"  --&gt;  3</code></pre>
